# Donar-Choose-Application-Screening-Using-Naive-Bayes

DonorsChoose.org provides funds to classroom projects. When it receives project proposals volunteers manually 
screen each submission before itâ€™s approved to be posted on the DonorsChoose.org website.

But as project proposals have increased and it requires resources to screen 500,000 projects. The objective of this is to predict 
whether or not a DonorsChoose.org project proposal submitted by a teacher will be approved, using the text of project descriptions as 
well as additional metadata about the project, teacher, and school. DonorsChoose.org can then use this information to identify p
rojects most likely to need further review before approval.
